# Portfolio

Hello Everyone,

  My name is Teagan Embrey and this is my portfolio.  I want to start by disclosing that all images used are from opensource resources such as unsplash.com.  My website that was built for a project called Teag's Wolf Funds, contains images from Shy Wolf Sanctuary with permission from them for use in school projects.
  
  I am graduating Clark College in August, 2023 with my AAT in Web Development, so my experience is limited to my schoolwork.  If the opportunity arises, I do plan to take on some freelance work, which I will add the links to those websites to my portfolio here.
  
  Thank you for taking the time to look over my portfolio.
